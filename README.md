# Code-Samples

### Sample code files for operating motors, sensors, etc...

## Goal of this reposotory
This is meant to be a refrence for future use. Any basic function should be placed in here. Ideally no one should ever have to make any type of basic code. By createing this libaray the block code and java code should be very easy to translate back and forth from. This libaray also contains example of JAVA syntax.

## How to use

1. What do you want to accpmlish?
  * Grab the ball
  * Find the white line
2. How is the robot going to do the task?
  * Use the arm to pick up the ball
  * Use a colour sensor to stop at the line
3. What sepicflly needs to happen to get it done
  * Move motor one to grasp the claw
  * Move all the motors forward then stop when the sensor sees the line
4. What code is need that can be copy pasted
  * Motor code, Claw Code?
  * Motor code, Sensor Code
5. What logic is needed
  * Wait then Grab
  * Move until
6. Write the logic
  * use print stanments in place of physical action on the robot
  * make sure this works before any thing is done on the robot
  * does not even have to be done in android studio
7. Fill in the blanks
  * Look for the nessacy code
  * Put it in where the physical actions need to be done
